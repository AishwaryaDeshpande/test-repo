# House Price Prediction
Hi GitHub!

Aishwarya here. This is the competition hosted by kaggle to predict the house prices using advanced regression techniques. I have shared the jupyter notebook for this project. These are the following sections in the notebook - 
1. Importing the datasets using pandas.
2. Data explorations 
    * looking at the missing data
    * Exploring the quatitative and qualitative variables
    * Data visialization 
3. Data Cleaning and Preocessing 
    * Replacing the missing data with appropriate values
    * Dealing with the outliers.
    * Looking at the skewed data and using box cox transformations and log transformation for target variable
    * Dealing with categorical variables and transforming them using label encoder and into dummy variables
4. Feature Engineering and Extraction 
    * Adding new features with the help of existing features 
    * Extracting the important features using 
          a) Statistical Tests (like chi2)
          b) Pearson's coefficients for quatitative variables
          c) Greedy Algorithm 
5. Model Development 
   The following models were built to and compared against each other to use the best model. 
    * Multiple Linear Regression
    * Ridge and Lasso Regression 
    * Bagging and Bossting Regression 
    * Voting Regressor 
    * Stacking Regressor
    * Random Forest 
    * Weighted Averahe Ensemble model
